# Project Distributed Systems #

### What is this repository for? ###

Project for the course Distributed Systems from Bachelor Computer Science at University Antwerp. 
A simple domotica system running on multiple computers.

### How do I get set up? ###

The folder `Final version' contains executable .jar files. 
First you need to start `Controller.jar'. After the controller is set up with an IP address, any other device can be started from a computer connected to the one running the controller. 

The .jar files are created from the source code found in the folder named `Project_iHome'.

All necessary libraries are included in the repository.
